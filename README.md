# Netflix-Recommendation-System
---
This is python based Netlix Recommendation System for Movies and TV Shows.
Netflix collects the watch history of the user and focuses on the genre, description, etc. 
Read it about the netflix recommendation algorithm more here : https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639
Here, I have imported the dataset from kaggle which contains the movie, tv shows available in Netflix.
The system works as a backend simulation and this code simulates the recommendation.
I have developed a function based on netflix's algorithm and it recommends movies and tv shows based on the user watch history.
It is developed in Python using Scikit module and cosine similarity which is mostly used for recommendation purposes.
